This repository serves as an entry point into processing/running visual discrimination puzzles (VDPs). To get started:

* Read our paper [here](https://atharvas.github.io/static/VDP22.pdf)!
* Try the demo notebook (`demo_vdp.ipynb`) to run/make your own natural scenes VDP puzzles in <5 minutes here: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/muraliadithya/vdp/blob/master/demo_vdp.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

* To replicate our results and use a wide selection of object detectors, follow the instructions in `## Installation` section.


## Structure

This repository is organized generally based on the generation/inference module used for our evaluation datasets. These modules are adapted versions of pre-existing tools. For attributions, we recommend looking at the `##Citations` section.

## Installation

Our instructions are specifically tuned to make it easy to replicate our results with minimal setup errors. A lot of these steps can be avoided in case of resource constraints.

1. Setup a Amazon AWS `p2.xlarge` instance. We used the `Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 16.04) Version 38.0 (ami-067cf9e6ac97cfb53) ` Amazon Machine Image with 105 GiB gp2 storage volume. Running all the experiments from scratch takes about 24-30 hours of compute time (less than $30). We were able to replicate all our experiments on a different server with a different GPU. However, running the `clevr_inference` module *requires* a Ubuntu 16.04 machine.
2. Clone this git repository. The homepath should look like `/home/ubuntu/vdp` (this *exact string* has been hardcoded in a lot of places. If you prefer running this on a local machine then you'll need to group-replace this path with your the project path).
3. Install the conda environments. There should be 4 `*-spec.txt` files in the `data/conda-envs` folder. Create a conda environment from these. That is:
```bash
$ conda create --name ns-vqa --file data/conda-envs/ns-vqa-spec.txt
$ conda create --name deep-ranking --file data/conda-envs/deep-ranking-spec.txt
$ conda create --name torch --file data/conda-envs/torch-spec.txt
$ conda create --name vdp --file data/conda-envs/vdp-spec.txt
```
4. Download the `data.zip` data bundle [here](https://utexas.box.com/s/rxd0fqoqya721bo3uqaaikpp9a7uk8v8) and merge this with the contents of `vdp/data`.
5. The `data.zip` file contains all the extra datafiles/configs/pretrained_models needed to replicate our results.
6. Setup darknet for getting bounding boxes from YOLOv4. Running `$ make clean && make` OR `$ ./build.sh` in `natscene_inference/darknet` should suffice. I suggest reading the readme in the darknet directory for setting up a particular GPU. The repo is setup to handle atleast the `NVIDIA K80`.


## Running a CLEVR puzzle.

Start by making a directory `data/clevr-cleaned-puzzles/test_puzzle`. Make a file `scene_file.json` that follows this format:
```
[
    { # Image 0   
        "objects": [
            {
                "x": -2.0,          # [-3, 3]
                "y": -2.0,          # [-3, 3]
                "z": 0.0,           # Ideally use 0. The inference engine isn't trained for >0.
                "size": "small",    # ["small", "large"]
                "shape": "sphere",  # ["cube", "sphere", "cylinder"]
                "color": "yellow",  # ["gray", "red", "blue", "green", "brown", "purple", "cyan", "yellow"]
                "orientation": 0.0, # [0, 360)
                "material": "rubber" # ["rubber", "metal"]
            },
            ...
        ]

    },
    ...
]
```
 -->

To run the CLEVR puzzle:
```bash
$ python clevr_driver.py --puzzle_dir data/clevr-cleaned-puzzles/test_puzzle --examples "3 4 5 6" --candidates "0 1 2" --vdp_flags "- 2 --autotune" --use_gpu
```
More information about `vdp_flags` can be found by running `python vdp_solver/scripts/vdpsolve.py --help`. Also, make sure you don't have any environment activated with `conda deactivate` before running this!

## Running a Natural scenes puzzle.

1. Assume we want to process a puzzle defined by `eg1.png, eg2.png, eg3.png, cand1.png, cand2.png, cand3.png`.
1. Put the images in `data/natscene_data/images/`.
1. Create a directory `data/natscene_data/puzzles/test_puzzle`. Make a file `config.json` with the follow format:
    ```
    {
        "name": "test_puzzle",
        "train": [
            "data/natscene_data/images/eg1.png",
            "data/natscene_data/images/eg2.png",
            "data/natscene_data/images/eg3.png"
        ],
        "test": [
            "data/natscene_data/images/cand1.png",
            "data/natscene_data/images/cand2.png",
            "data/natscene_data/images/cand3.png"
        ]
    }
    ```
1. Run the natural scenes puzzles with the default YOLO bounding box detector:
    ```
    $ python natscene_driver.py --config "data/natscene_data/puzzles/test_puzzle/config.json" --vdp_flags "- 3 --autotune" --regenerate
    ```
1. The output of the solver will be written to `data/natscene_data/processed/test_puzzle.out`.


## Data

The `data/` folder contains all data used by the tool chain. This includes pretrained models, csv files, json configuration files, etc. The data directory can be downloaded here and is subject to a fair use in research agreement (8.6 GB): `https://utexas.box.com/s/rxd0fqoqya721bo3uqaaikpp9a7uk8v8`. This does not include the natural scenes images because we weren't able to track the licences for some of the files. Please email us directly about this.



## Contact Us

The fastest way to reach the authors for any debugging help is by opening a GitHub issue. This also helps us document and address potential "gotchas." For data related issues, please email the authors directly at `adithya5@illinois.edu` or `atharvas@utexas.edu`.


## Common Gotcha's (Known Issues)

* The triplet_loss_baseline is written in Tensorflow/Keras. Keras documents default behavior in `~/.keras/keras.json`. The default behavior of `image_dim_ordering` is different for the triplet loss baseline so if you run into batch dimension errors, messing with the `image_dim_ordering` will help.
