"""
Primary module of the GuardedConjunctiveSolver package.  
Interprets the arguments given to the parser in guardedconjunctivesolver.parser to initialise the solver class in 
guardedconjunctivesolver.guardedconjunctivesolver.GuardedConjunctiveSolver with the appropriate options.  

Every solve_puzzle module must define a solve_puzzle function that searches for the solution to a given VDP puzzle in 
the class defined by the <package>.formula module.  
Refer the package description to learn more about the role of this module.
